Problem description:
  The 128x128 thumbnails get blurry when zoomed in.

How to reproduce:
  Zoom into an image that is larger than 128x128 in size.

What happened:
  The image gets blurry.

What should have happened:
  The image shouldn't get blurry 
  (before hitting the image's native resolution.)

Proposed solution:
  Modify PreDraw to load images at view-width size when zoomed in. 

  Modify DrawThumb to use the view-width image when thumb scale > 1.

  Modify FSCache thumbnail caching to keep a very short-lived cache
  of view-width images.
