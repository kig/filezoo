Problem description:
If you create a subdirectory and add files to it over a period of 
several seconds, the files of the last second may not be noticed.

How to reproduce:
Paste to dwim-bar, may take a couple dozen tries:
mkdir foo; for i in `seq 1 100`; do touch foo/$i; done

What happened:
Less than 100 entries are shown, can't get more to show.

What should have happened:
All 100 entries should appear.

Probable cause:
  - the long monitor and the FSCache use mtime 
  - mtime accuracy is one second
  - if changes happen to an unwatched [== i.e. long monitor] 
    directory during the second after it is updated, the
    directory mtime stays the same and the changes are not 
    noticed

How to fix:
if (DateTime.Now.Subtract(mtime).TotalSeconds < 1) treat as changed

FIXED

Should work now, at least can't duplicate.
