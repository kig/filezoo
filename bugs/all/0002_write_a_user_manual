Problem description:

There is no way to find out which button does what, apart from reading 
the source, and even that is super duper hard as the functionality is 
spread all across filezoo.cs's event handling code.

Proposed solution:

Write a manual that describes the available controls.
Get rid of all controls that require being in the manual.
Throw away the manual.
