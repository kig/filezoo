Problem description:
The throw-scrolling doesn't sample velocity over time, but velocity over 
motion events. Which means that stopping the mouse pointer doesn't 
reduce throw velocity to zero.

How to reproduce:
Pan with left mouse button, rapidly stop mouse from moving, wait a few 
seconds, release button.

What happened:
The view starts scrolling.

What should've happened:
Nothing.

Proposed solution:
Add timestamp to motion events, take it into account when computing the 
velocity. A quick fix would be to keep a LastMotion timestamp and only 
do a throw if it's larger than DateTime.Now - 0.5 sec or somesuch.
