Problem description:
Some fonts with embedded bitmaps may cause a NoMemory error on the Cairo 
context. 

How to reproduce:
Draw "ç¬¬" with "AR PL UMing CN Light" 
font embedded bitmaps turned on
font size 1.5 * PANGO_SCALE
identity matrix

Proposed solution:
Heck do I know, tell people to not use such fonts? Or use only integer 
font sizes. Or render big text to an image surface and draw small text 
by scaling it.
