Problem description:
  Filezoo.FindHits is slow for large (10 k+ entries) directories.
  The FindHits runtimes oscillate between 10 ms and 50 ms, which
  would point to it triggering some transient effect.

How to reproduce:
  Go to a dir with ten thousand entries, zoom in, throw-pan, move mouse 
  around.
  
What happens:
  Mouse movement causes framerate to drop.

Proposed solution:
  Either find a way to make FindHits fast or do FindHits only once per 
  frame.
