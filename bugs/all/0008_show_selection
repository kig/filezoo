Problem description:
  I don't know if I have something selected or not.
  Selection status is not visible.
  Selected items are not visible if you have navigated them out of sight.

How to reproduce:
  Select items, zoom out until they vanish.
  Select items, pan until none are visible.

What happened:
  There is no selection visible on the screen, 
  yet there are files in the selection.

What did you expect:
  For the selection status to be visible regardless
  of the filesystem view.

Proposed solution:
  Add a "X files selected [^]" statusbar
  [clicking which toggles a list of the selected items]
