Problem description:

I don't know if a piece of code works correctly or not.


How to reproduce:

Add some method that compiles, wonder if it works right or not.


Proposed solution:

Use mono's code coverage tools: http://www.mono-project.com/Code_Coverage
Make the tests a part of the build process.
Run tests automatically before git push.
Run tests automatically on file change.
Put a traffic light tests-pass applet into the desktop panel.
