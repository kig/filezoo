Filezoo is a zoomable file manager that can be used as an FVWM panel applet.

Filezoo's goals are taking care of casual file management and looking cool.
Its technical goals are effective visualization and a responsive animated UI.
Most directories open in under 100ms (== time from clicking the directory to
first frame drawn) on my 2GHz computer, and the framerate is generally higher
than 20fps.

Filezoo is written in C# using Mono, Gtk# and Cairo.

Note: While this thing works and is the bestest file manager ever, 
I'm not working on it actively. Making Filezoo into a Gnome panel applet 
would be useful. Making the drag-drop-selection-fiddle-UI less bad would
also be useful. Not to mention making the commandline completion work better 
and have a command history. And using the same file opening framework as the
rest of Gnome, and fixing the UI to flow better. And porting the renderer
over to OpenGL as CAIRO DOES NOT GET FASTER, EVER.
