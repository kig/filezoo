Filezoo is a minimalistic filesystem browser that has view modes for visualizing
the disk usage of files and directories both in terms of bytes and file count.

Filezoo's guiding principles are effective visualization and blinding speed.
Most directories open in under 100ms (== time from clicking the directory to
first frame drawn) on my 2GHz computer.

  mono
  libgtk2.0-cil
