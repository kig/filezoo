Filezoo is a zoomable file manager that can be used as an FVWM panel applet.

Filezoo's goals are taking care of casual file management and looking cool.
Its technical goals are effective visualization and a responsive animated UI.
Most directories open in under 100ms (== time from clicking the directory to
first frame drawn) on my 2GHz computer, and the framerate is generally higher
than 20fps.
