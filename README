Filezoo is a minimalistic filesystem browser that has view modes for visualizing
the disk usage of files and directories both in terms of bytes and file count.

Filezoo's development principles are visualization and blinding speed. Most
directories open in under 100ms (== time from clicking the directory to first
frame drawn) on my 2GHz computer.

Filezoo uses Cairo for the drawing and Gtk# for the windows.

Requirements:
  mono
  libgtk2.0-cil
  libmono-cairo2.0-cil

Compile by:
  ./build.sh

Usage:
  bin/filezoo.exe [directory]
